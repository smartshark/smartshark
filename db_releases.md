## Data Releases

As part of SmartSHARK, we have already collect large amount of data, that we already used in our publications. 
Since we are still incrementally updating and improving our database, we decided to organize our usage of the database in release from here on out and try to include
the releases we already used in publications. Each release comes with a description of the data, as well as the requirements for using the release (e.g., the MongoDB version). 

### Release 1

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Short description | This is the first major release of the SmartSHARK MongoDB and data for 38 Java Apache projects. For each project, the data contains the issue tracking data, mailing list data, and version control data, including software metrics, PMD warnings, change type analysis, automated refactoring detection, links between commits and issues, commit labels, and inducing changes. The type of the linked bug issues and the issue links of these data sets were manually validated. |
