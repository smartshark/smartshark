## Data Releases

As part of SmartSHARK, we have already collect large amount of data, that we already used in our publications. 
Since we are still incrementally updating and improving our database, we decided to organize our usage of the database in release from here on out and try to include
the releases we already used in publications. Each release comes with a description of the data, as well as the requirements for using the release (e.g., the MongoDB version).
