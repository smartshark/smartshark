As part of SmartSHARK, we have already collect large amount of data, that we already used in our publications. 
Since we are still incrementally updating and improving our database, we decided to organize our usage of the database in release from here on out and try to include
the releases we already used in publications. An increase of the minor version means that more that for the existing projects was added. With major version we also always add more projects.
