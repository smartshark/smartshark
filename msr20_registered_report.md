Thank you for your interest in the participation in our study on the manual labeling
of bug fixing lines that is [registered with the OSF](https://osf.io/acnwk) and part
of the MSR 2020 registered reports track. 

Our goal is to provide a large corpus of bug fixing commits, where we know for each
changed line whether it contributed to the bugfix or not. You can watch this short
video on YouTube to see how the validation works.

Contact Details

Name:
Email: 
Experience: 
Desired pseudonym: 

With the submission of this form via Email to herbold@cs.uni-goettingen.de you
give your consent for the storage and handling of your personal data as described below. 

Information regarding required data and data privacy:

Please use an official university or company address if possible, or any other address
that we can use to validate your identity. If this is not possible, we will try to work
out a different way to confirm your identity.

Please indicate your experience such that we can see if you meet one the following
criteria: “1) an under-graduate degree majoring in computer science or a closely related
subject; or 2) at least one year of programming experience in Java, demonstrated either
by industrial programming experience using Java or through contributions to Java open
source projects.” In case you contributed to open source projects, please provide links. 

The pseudonym will be the name of your account and cannot be changed afterwards. The 
pseudonym is also used to identify which lines you labeled and how you labelled them. 
The pseudonym will become part of the publicly shared data set. If you select the
pseudonym such that it may be used to identify yourself (e.g., sherbold), we
see this as consent for sharing this pseudonym publicly within the data set as described above. 
In case you do not provide a pseudonym, we will generate a random pseudonym for you which 
will provide you anonymity in the data set. We note that it may be possible to
de-anonymize the pseudonyms in case you become a co-author of the manuscript, because 
the author order depends on the labeled data. 

This form will be stored encrypted and is only accessible by Steffen Herbold. The form will
be deleted upon acceptance of the manuscript that describes our study. Your email address
and pseudonym will be shared with Alexander Trautsch and only be used by him to send you the
credentials for the data labeling platform. Steffen Herbold may also contact you via your
Email address with information relevant for the study, e.g., the current progress, or in case
you meet the criteria for authorship and are invited to contribute to the manuscript.
