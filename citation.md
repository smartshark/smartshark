title: Citing SmartSHARK
permalink: /citation/
---

There are multiple publications on SmartSHARK and and the curation of data through releases. Depending on which tools or data from the SmartSHARK ecosystem you are using, different citations are appropriate, possibly even multiple citations to give proper credit to the people involved in different projects. This guide should help you to decide what to cite.

| You compare SmartSHARK to other repository mining tools, are interested in the general architecture of SmartSHARK, or the implications on external validity that motivate our work. | @article{Trautsch2017,<br>author = {Fabian Trautsch and Steffen Herbold and Philip Makedonski and Jens Grabowski},<br>title = {Addressing problems with replicability and validity of repository mining studies through a smart data platform},<br>journal = {Empirical Software Engineering},<br>year = {2017},<br>volume = {23},<br>number = {2},<br>pages = {1036--1083},<br>doi = {10.1007/s10664-017-9537-x},<br>publisher = {Springer Science and Business Media {LLC}}<br>} |
| You are using SmartSHARK for data collection or validation or want to state that SmartSHARK was used by other for this purpose. | @article{Trautsch2017,<br>author = {Fabian Trautsch and Steffen Herbold and Philip Makedonski and Jens Grabowski},<br>title = {Addressing problems with replicability and validity of repository mining studies through a smart data platform},<br>journal = {Empirical Software Engineering},<br>year = {2017},<br>volume = {23},<br>number = {2},<br>pages = {1036--1083},<br>doi = {10.1007/s10664-017-9537-x},<br>publisher = {Springer Science and Business Media {LLC}}<br>} |

| You are using the SmartSHARK MongoDB 1.1, but you are not using the manual validation of changes on a line level. | @Misc{Herbold2019,<br>author = {Steffen Herbold and Alexander Trautsch and Fabian Trautsch and Benjamin Ledel},<br>title = {Issues with SZZ: An empirical assessment of the state of practice of defect prediction data collection},<br>year = {2019},<br>archiveprefix = {arXiv},<br>eprint = {1911.08938},<br>} |
| You are using the SmartSHARK MongoDB 1.1 and are using only the manual validation of changes on the line level but no other data. | Coming Soon |
| You are using the SmartSHARK MongoDB 1.1 and are using the manual validation of changes AND other data, e.g., manually validated issue types, inducing changes, or even mailing list data. | @Misc{Herbold2019,<br>author = {Steffen Herbold and Alexander Trautsch and Fabian Trautsch and Benjamin Ledel},<br>title = {Issues with SZZ: An empirical assessment of the state of practice of defect prediction data collection},<br>year = {2019},<br>archiveprefix = {arXiv},<br>eprint = {1911.08938},<br>}<br><br>AND<br><br>Coming Soon |
